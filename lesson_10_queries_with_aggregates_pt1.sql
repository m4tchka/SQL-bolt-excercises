/* 
    This lesson introduces aggregate functions, which are useful at finding various metrics of a column (sum, count, max etc) and returning them as 1 line, without having to do more logic in a backend. 

    GROUP BY is also introduced here, which will allow individual metrics to be returned, for each different value in the column specified.

    Without a GROUP BY, the aggregate function will calculate based on every row in the table.
