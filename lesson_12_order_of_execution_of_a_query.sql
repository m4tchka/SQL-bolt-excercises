/* 
    This lesson combined some of the clauses of previous lessons with the GROUP BY operator.
    Execution order: 
        FROM & JOIN - Determine total working set of data & creates a temporary table containing joined table/s + columns
        WHERE - Discard rows not satisfying these conditions
        GROUP BY - Rows with same value for the specified column are grouped - leaving as many rows as unique values for that column
        HAVING - Discard groups not satisfying these conditions
        SELECT - Expressions & specific columns are now computed
        DISTINCT - Discard rows with duplicate values for DISTINCT column
        ORDER BY - Remaining rows sorted by column (aliases accepted)
        LIMIT & OFFSET - Discard rows outside of the limit / offset
        
    As shown by the example query at the top, these queries can get quite long, but being able to specifically target certain data to return can remove a lot of logic on back/front ends, and so is absolutely worth learning.
