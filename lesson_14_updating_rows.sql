/* 
    The incoming data must match data type of the receiving column/s, otherwise fairly self-explanatory.
    Advises users to use a SELECT * FROM table WHERE ... clause first, to test that the WHERE clause to be used to specify the rows to be updated are the correct rows.
    Best to use ID (or whatever primary key) to select if you know for sure the contents of the table ?
